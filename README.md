# Julia for Scientific Computing



This books is meant to serve as an introduction to the use of the Julia language for scientific computing. The material covered will be broad in scope, and will emphasize the use of Julia for mathematics and statistics as they are applied to the physical, life, and social sciences. Early chapters will discuss fundamental concepts in Julia, but we assume the reader already has some experience with imperative-style languages in the family tree of C \(e.g., C++, Java, Scala, Ruby, Python, R\).

The early chapters will cover some more fundamental concepts that are common in many other languages, so the experienced reader may move more quickly through these portions. However, we also expect that even readers with a great deal of experience will benefit from the material in these early chapters, as it discusses some of the particulars of Julia that set it appart from other languages.
